   (( n: I glanced around for a makeshift weapon... ))

   (( n: How do you kill a ghost? ))

   (( n: I took Tom's Athame dagger from the table. ))

   (( n: I held it threateningly towards the ghost. ))

   (( m: Leave us alone! ))

   (( n: The ghost kept approaching us... Her floating "stride" didn't even break... ))

   (( m: STOP IT! ))

   (( n: I swung the Athame and cut the ghost straight throught the middle. ))

   (( n: The ghost of Clara torn in half like a cloud of smoke. ))

   (( n: She no longer appeared solid, like a person... ))

   (( n: Clara slowly faded into the mist... ))

   (( n: And just like that... She was gone for good. ))

   (( n: I reached the basement, which turned out to be a cellar. ))

   (( n: Barrels filled with wine lined all over the room. ))

   (( n: At least, I think it was wine. But with how the rest of this mansion was designed, there were probably seven or eight barrels that probably opened up to a secret passage... ))

   (( n: I took another look around and noticed... something else. ))

   (( n: There was an old suit of armor on a wooden stand. ))
